This is a sample PHP code that displays the salary and bonus payment dates.
Starting from the current month +1 year.
Salary dates are calculated as last day of month, if it's a weekend then salary date is shifted to before.
Bonus dates are calculated as current month + 1 month - 15 days and if that date is a weekend then bonus date is shifted to after.
Implements unit testing in php.
